# Zillow Price Prediction
A project using regression to develop predictions to beat the Zestimate. 

## About the Project 

### Project Goals

My goals are to address identify the key features that impact home price in the Southern California market so that I can build a predictive model that accurately predicts single family home price and make recommendations to increase the accuracy of predictive power in future models for deployment.

### Project Description

This project looked at features impacting home prices in Ventura, LA, and Orange County. Accurately predicting home price is important for not only Zillow, but all customers interested in purchasing a home. The California market is notoriously prohibitive for price sensitive consumers, building an accurate predictive model based on attributes known to drive price and customizing that to California's unique landscape creates a more knowledgable customer base. 


### Initial Questions

1. Is area (in sqft) positively correlated with home price in the SoCal market?
2. Is there a relationship between pre-war homes, defined in this project as homes built before 1945 and homes built afterwards?
3. Is home price different across counties?
4. Does access to the beach and mountains play a role in home price?

### Project Planning

    Acquire data from the Codeup Database and store the process as a function for replication. Save the function in a wrangle.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.

    View data to gain understanding of the dataset and to create the readme.

    Create README.md with data dictionary, project and business goals, documentation of the initial hypotheses.

    Clean and prepare data for the first iteration through the data pipeline. Store this as a function to automate the process, store the function in the wrangle.py module, and prepare data in Final Report Notebook by importing and using the funtion.

    Clearly define at least two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, and document findings and takeaways.

    Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.

    Train four different regression models.

    Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.

    Choose the model with that performs the best and evaluate that single model on the test dataset.

    Document executive summary, conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in the Final Report Notebook.

    Upload README.md, Data Dictionary, wrangle.py, Project Scratch Notebook, Final Report Notebook


### Steps to Reproduce


For example: 

1. You will need an env.py file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the zillow dataset. Store that env file locally in the repository. 
2. Clone my repository (including the wrangle3.py) and confirm .gitignore is hiding your env.py file.
3. Import all libraries in first cell of report, a pip install of any unfamiliar libraries into your local system may be required.
4. Dowload wrangle3.py from this repository.
5. Use wrangle to acquire and prep the data. 

#### Wrangle

##### Module (wrangle3.py)

- This module contains user defined functions to acquire and prepare the data.

- These functions:

1. Acquire data from SQL database and store a cached version.
2. Drop outliers using IQR rule.
3. Change column names.
4. Train, test, and split data.
5. Scale data.
6. Scale data based on county.


##### Missing Values (report.ipynb)

- Missing values handled following the IQR principle first.

- Irrelevant data (transaction not in 2017) dropped.

- Nulls dropped.

- Data retention: 78.4%
